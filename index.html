                        The release of this device was the beginning of the smartphone era, 
                        which is why the video above is such a big moment in history.

                    <li class="text-animate hidden">
                        The 2nd iPhone generation
                    </li>
                    <li class="text-animate hidden">

                    <li class="text-animate hidden">
                        Exterior design mostly stayed the same, however the biggest improvement
                        was the ability to work on the 3G network which made internet access much faster. 
                    </li>
                    <li class="text-animate hidden">
                        A 3GS model also came out soon after, which was the first inclusion
                        of voice control in an iPhone. Although it was very janky and terrible to use,
                        it paved the way for what we now know today as Siri.

                        The first ever iPhone to use an apple made processor (Apple A4)

                    <li class="text-animate hidden">
                       This iPhone was much faster than its previous generations, which made
                       people go crazy for it, especially since it was the same price as the 3G
                    </li>
                    <li class="text-animate hidden">
                        Other than the better processor, the only differences were that it
                        looks much nicer (one of my favourite iPhone looks) and a better camera 
                        that was capable of shooting 480P video.
